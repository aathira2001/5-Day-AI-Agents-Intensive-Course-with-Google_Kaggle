Imagine breaking down your systems into intelligent, independent components that collaborate seamlessly to achieve a common goal. This is the power of multi-agent systems (MAS) – a transformative paradigm that's quietly reshaping software development.\n\nMAS presents a compelling alternative to traditional approaches by decomposing intricate problems into smaller, manageable, agent-sized tasks. This enhanced modularity translates directly to cleaner codebases and significantly easier debugging. Crucially, it allows for the independent development, testing, and updating of individual components, drastically reducing the risk of introducing bugs when modifying one part of the system. Moreover, well-defined agents with specific functionalities can be readily reused across multiple projects, saving valuable development time and effort.\n\nBeyond improved maintainability, MAS substantially bolsters system robustness and resilience. The decentralized nature of MAS means that the failure of a single agent doesn't necessarily bring the entire system crashing down; other agents can adapt or even step in to cover the missing functionality. This inherent fault tolerance, combined with the ability for agents to exhibit adaptive behavior and respond dynamically to changing conditions, creates systems that are significantly more resilient.\n\nPerformance and scalability also experience dramatic improvements. With agents operating concurrently, MAS enables true parallel processing, significantly boosting application throughput. Their inherent design lends itself perfectly to distributed architectures, making it effortless to scale across multiple machines and servers while allowing for highly efficient resource allocation.\n\nFinally, MAS unlock entirely new possibilities for software innovation. They are exceptionally well-suited for complex problem-solving, enabling sophisticated simulations, intelligent automation, and intricate coordination tasks.

Here are a few suggestions to enhance it further:\n\n1.  **Develop Elias's \"lonely tower\" and his existing life:** Briefly hint at Elias's routine and his feelings about his solitary existence. Is he content, resigned, or yearning for something more? This will make his reaction to the map, and the potential for adventure, even more impactful. For example, you could add a sentence like, \"He’d grown accustomed to the predictable rhythm of the waves and the solitary companionship of the gulls, a life that offered safety but little surprise.\"\n\n2.  **Strengthen the map's description and the immediate sensory experience:** While the description of the map is good, consider adding more specific sensory details. What does the \"impossibly smooth, flexible material\" feel like beyond its shimmer? Does the luminescence have a temperature? Does it emit a sound? This can deepen the mystery and Elias's connection to the object. For instance, instead of just \"shimmered like moonlight on water,\" you could say, \"shimmered with a cool, internal light, feeling strangely warm to the touch.\"\n\n3.  **Introduce a subtle foreshadowing of the map's purpose or origin:** The map's celestial and geographical oddities are fascinating. You could weave in a small detail that hints at *why* this map has appeared to Elias, or who might have created it. This could be a symbol on the map that Elias vaguely recognizes, or a fleeting thought that crosses his mind. For example, \"He traced a spiral that reminded him of the storm patterns his grandfather, a sailor of forgotten tales, used to describe.\"\nRefinerAgent > The salt spray kissed Elias’s weathered face as he trimmed the lamp, its familiar hiss a counterpoint to the ceaseless roar of the sea.

What if the first draft of our story is bad? We have no way to review it and ask for a rewrite.\n\n**The Solution: Iterative Refinement**\n\nWhen a task needs to be improved through cycles of feedback and revision, you can use a `LoopAgent`. A `LoopAgent` runs a set of sub-agents repeatedly *until a specific condition is met or a maximum number of iterations is reached.* This creates a refinement cycle, allowing the agent system to improve its own work over and over.\n\n**Use Loop when:** Iterative improvement is needed, quality refinement matters, or you need repeated cycles.\n\nTo learn more, check out the documentation related to [loop agents in ADK](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/agents/workflow-agents/loop-agents/).\n\n**Architecture: Story Writing & Critique Loop**\n\n<!--\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[\"Initial Prompt\"] -- > B[\"Writer Agent\"]\n    B -- >|story| C[\"Critic Agent\"]\n    C -- >|critique| D{\"Iteration < Max<br>AND<br>Not Approved?\"}\n    D -- >|Yes| B\n    D -- >|No| E[\"Final Story\"]\n\n    style B fill:#ccffcc\n    style C fill:#ffcccc\n    style D fill:#ffffcc\n```\n-->","metadata":{"id":"fP4I3mvtBtHF"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<img width=\"250\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/github-repo/kaggle-5days-ai/day1/loop-agent.png\" alt=\"Loop Agent\" />","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 5.1 Example: Iterative Story Refinement\n\nLet's build a system with two agents:\n\n1. **Writer Agent** - Writes a draft of a short story\n2. **Critic Agent** - Reviews and critiques the short story to suggest improvements","metadata":{"id":"fP4I3mvtBtHF"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# This agent runs ONCE at the beginning to create the first draft.\ninitial_writer_agent = Agent(\n    name=\"InitialWriterAgent\",\n    model=\"gemini-2.5-flash-lite\",\n    instruction=\"\"\"Based on the user's prompt, write the first draft of a short story (around 100-150 words).\n    Output only the story text, with no introduction or explanation.\"\"\",\n    output_key=\"current_story\", # Stores the first draft in the state.\n)\n\nprint(\"✅ initial_writer_agent created.\")","metadata":{"id":"a2b8WlJoBtHF","outputId":"13ed1e15-dcf9-4e1d-ad1e-fb18ee793de5","trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-11-10T00:11:10.311514Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-11-10T00:11:10.311933Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-11-10T00:11:10.318323Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-11-10T00:11:10.311902Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-11-10T00:11:10.31685Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# This agent's only job is to provide feedback or the approval signal.
